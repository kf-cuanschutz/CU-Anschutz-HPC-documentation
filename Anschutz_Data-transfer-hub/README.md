# Overview:
-------------
This folder contains files related to the Anschutz data transfer hub.
The data transfer hub was created to facilitate very difficult data transfers from an Anschutz server to Alpine.
One can just mount a folder of interest that he wishes to transfer and initiate the 
operation via scp, rsync or globus. Note that the data transfer hub is not a powerful system, and thus you need to email us at hpcsupport@cuanschutz.edu 
and describe your particular case and we will determine if this transfer method is the most appropriate one for you. 

## Warning: 
Most of Anschutz users do not need to use the data transfer hub to transfer their data to Alpine. This data transfer hub only applies to **very marginal cases**!


## Procedure to access the hub, mount the server drive and initiate a data transfer:

* For information on how to access the hub and mount an external drive there please refer to this [guide](https://github.com/kf-cuanschutz/CU-Anschutz-HPC-documentation/blob/main/Anschutz_Data-transfer-hub/data_hub_onboarding.md).

* For information on how to use globus-cli on the hub please refer to this [guide](https://github.com/kf-cuanschutz/CU-Anschutz-HPC-documentation/blob/main/Anschutz_Data-transfer-hub/globus-cli_on_the_dthub.md).
